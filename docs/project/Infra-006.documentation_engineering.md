# Infra-006: Documentation Engineering

**Status**: In Progress  
**Owner**: Infra  
**Priority**: P2  
**Branch**: `feat/ssot-bootstrap-pitfalls`

## Goal
Establish a repeatable documentation engineering workflow with measurable link reachability.

## Context
The wiki has multiple entry points and deep references; we need consistent navigation, reachability, and maintenance checks.

## Scope
- [x] Define L0/L1/L2 entry map and update cross-links.
- [x] Add a lightweight link reachability check (script or checklist).
- [x] Normalize entry ordering across key docs for discoverability.

## Deliverables
- L0/L1/L2 entry map documented in AGENTS and docs index.
- Link reachability report or checklist for reviews.
- Updated navigation ordering across L1 entry docs.

## PR Links
- None yet.

## Change Log
| Date | Change |
|------|--------|
| 2025-12-31 | Initialized project |

| 2025-12-31 | Added reachability report and PageRank findings |
| 2025-12-31 | Linked Bootstrap/E2E subdocs and closed reachability gaps |

## Verification
- [ ] L0 to L2 docs are reachable in <= 2 hops.
- [ ] Link check passes for local docs.
